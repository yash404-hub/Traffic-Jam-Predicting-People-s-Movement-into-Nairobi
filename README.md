# 🚦 Traffic Jam Prediction: Modeling People's Movement into Nairobi

This project aims to predict traffic congestion in Nairobi by analyzing patterns in human movement. Leveraging data science and machine learning, it provides insights into urban mobility and helps forecast traffic jams with greater accuracy.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict traffic jams based on people's movement data
- **Location Focus**: Nairobi, Kenya
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
- **Approach**: Data preprocessing → Feature engineering → Model training → Evaluation

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes anonymized movement data of individuals entering Nairobi. It contains:
- Timestamps
- Entry points
- Movement frequency
- Traffic density indicators

> 📁 *Note: Dataset is either publicly available or simulated for demonstration purposes.*

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization
- **Feature Engineering**: Time-based features, location clustering
- **Model Used**: Random Forest, XGBoost (can be extended to LSTM for time series)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 📈 Results

- Achieved **XX% accuracy** in predicting traffic congestion
- Visualized movement trends and traffic hotspots
- Identified peak congestion hours and high-risk zones

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
